RaspiCorder
===========

This project is inteded to turn the Raspberry Pi into a fully self contained audio recorder which saves files to the SD card which can be read elsewhere. Audio input is via USB. Input and output are done via two line displayer.

The exact 2 line display this is designed for is the Adafruit 2 line LCD display with keypad which can be found [here](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1110). Will work with both the positive, negative and multi-colour displays.

The folders beginning with Adafruit are from the Adafruit official repository. Included are all of the original files needed to setup the plate. If you haven't done any setup for the LCD plate on your raspberry pi, please see the [tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-16x2-character-lcd-plus-keypad-for-raspberry-pi).
